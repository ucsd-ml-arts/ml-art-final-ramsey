## Abstract Proposal

We wanted our final project to be a creative improvement which could provide users with a sense of customization. So, we decided to expand upon our previous project, which allowed users to copy different dresses onto a picture of their choosing, usually that of torso. Our project aims to expand upon several topics covered in the class, such as the different style transfers as well as deep photo stylization. To expand our project idea, we decided to add similar designs, such as Starbucks drinks and different galaxies or planets. All of these designs will be shown in our live demo next Wednesday.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
