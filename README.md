## Abstract Proposal

We wanted our final project to be a creative improvement which could provide users with a sense of customization. So, we decided to expand upon our previous project, which allowed users to copy different dresses onto a picture of their choosing, usually that of torso. Our project aims to expand upon several topics covered in the class, such as the different style transfers as well as deep photo stylization. To expand our project idea, we decided to add similar designs, such as Starbucks drinks and different galaxies or planets. All of these designs will be shown in our live demo next Wednesday.

## Project Report

[Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gokefTnvX6NNzY5B61TNsCVLeevw0dsjagjcHG8pNeQ/edit).

## Model/Data

This repository includes none of the code for the actual project - that can be found on the Observable notebooks and Glitch apps below.

## Code

- The [main Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/6042cb21712df80d) (direct code [here](https://api.observablehq.com/d/6042cb21712df80d.js?v=3))
- The [main Glitch app](http://ece188-ramsey.glitch.me) (ports the above Observable notebook into a slightly easier to use format) (direct code [here](https://glitch.com/~ece188-ramsey))

## Results

Some example pictures can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xudyeAiToY4Ktja6jlcVFE6d1R67NXAK?usp=sharing).

## Technical Notes

The entire project can be ran in most modern web browsers from the [Glitch app](http://ece188-ramsey.glitch.me). There may be issues on some low-end browsers (libary incompatability, network issues, etc), but should work on most desktop clients. We tested on an updated Chrome browser on a Windows computer.
